# Frontend Vulnerability Scan Report

This report details the findings of a security scan conducted on the Angular frontend code located in `packages/frontend/src/`. The scan focused on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and QR Code input sanitization.

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Methodology:**
*   Automated `grep` search for common XSS-related Angular patterns: `[innerHTML]`, `[outerHTML]`, `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, `document.write`.
*   Manual review of component templates and code to analyze how data, especially data from TinyBase (via `ReactiveStoreService`), is rendered.

**Findings:**

*   **Automated Search:** The `grep` search for patterns like `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, and `document.write` yielded **no matches** in the codebase. This is a positive indication, suggesting that direct unsafe DOM manipulations are likely not being used.

*   **Manual Review of Data Binding:**
    *   **`packages/frontend/src/app/editor/editor.component.html` and `editor.component.ts`**:
        *   The primary data display from TinyBase is handled by binding the `content` FormControl (which receives data from `ReactiveStoreService.getText()`) to a `<textarea>` element:
            ```html
            <textarea [formControl]="content" ...></textarea>
            ```
        *   Angular's `FormControl` and its binding to `<textarea>` treat the content as plain text. The value is set as the textarea's `value` property, not interpreted as HTML. This is a safe way to handle potentially user-generated content from TinyBase.
    *   **Angular's Default Sanitization:** Angular, by default, treats all bindings to HTML properties (like `[value]`, `[id]`, etc.) and interpolations (`{{ value }}`) as unsafe and applies sanitization to prevent XSS. Since no explicit bypassing of this sanitization was found, it's assumed these default protections are active.

**Conclusion for XSS:**
No direct XSS vulnerabilities were identified. The application appears to correctly leverage Angular's built-in data binding mechanisms (e.g., `FormControl` for textareas, property binding) which provide default XSS protection by treating bound values as text unless explicitly told otherwise (which was not found). The risk of XSS from data received via TinyBase and rendered in the reviewed components is currently **low**.

## 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Methodology:**
*   Review of HTTP client usage and how state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) are handled.
*   Consideration of Angular's default XSRF protection.

**Findings:**
*   The application's primary mode of server communication for data synchronization is via **WebSockets** (`WsSynchronizer` from TinyBase), as seen in `packages/frontend/src/app/reactive-store.service.ts`.
*   No explicit custom Angular `HttpClient` calls performing state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) were found in the scanned components or services.
*   Angular applications generated with the Angular CLI typically include `HttpClientXsrfModule` by default, providing protection against CSRF for HTTP requests. While not explicitly verified in `app.config.ts` during this scan, the absence of relevant HTTP requests makes this a less immediate concern.
*   The authentication cookie (`auth`) set by the backend (`src/index.ts`) uses `SameSite=Strict`, which is a strong defense against CSRF attacks on the cookie itself.

**Conclusion for CSRF:**
The risk of CSRF is **low**. The application relies on WebSockets for its core functionality, and no traditional state-changing HTTP requests that would be primary CSRF targets were identified. The authentication cookie also employs `SameSite=Strict` protection.

## 3. QR Code Input Sanitization

**Methodology:**
*   Locate usage of the `qrcode` library.
*   Analyze the data source for QR code generation and assess risks.

**Findings:**
*   **Usage:** The `QrCodeComponent` in `packages/frontend/src/app/qr-code/qr-code.component.ts` uses `qrcode.toCanvas()` to render a QR code.
    ```typescript
    // packages/frontend/src/app/qr-code/qr-code.component.ts
    @Input() url: string = 'https://google.com';
    // ...
    toCanvas(this.qrCodeCanvasEl.nativeElement, this.url, { /* ... */ });
    ```
*   **Data Source:** The `url` input for the `app-qr-code` component is provided in `packages/frontend/src/app/editor/editor.component.html` as:
    ```html
    <app-qr-code [url]="url"></app-qr-code>
    ```
    The `url` property in `EditorComponent` is set to `window.location.href`:
    ```typescript
    // packages/frontend/src/app/editor/editor.component.ts
    url = window.location.href;
    ```
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   The data used for QR code generation is the current browser URL (`window.location.href`). This means the QR code helps users share the link to the current collaborative session.
    *   The content of the QR code is not derived from user-supplied data that is synchronized through TinyBase (e.g., the text being edited).
    *   **Malicious URLs:** While not an XSS vector through TinyBase data, if a user could be tricked into navigating to a maliciously crafted URL (e.g., one containing a `javascript:` payload, though this is often mitigated by modern QR scanners and browsers), and then generating a QR code from *that* URL, there could be a risk to the *scanner* of the QR code. However, this is an indirect risk related to the source URL itself, not a vulnerability in how the QR code component handles data from the collaborative session.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Extremely long URLs could generate complex QR codes. However, `window.location.href` is subject to browser and server URL length limitations, making this risk minimal.

**Conclusion for QR Code Sanitization:**
The QR code component is safe in the context of data from TinyBase, as it uses `window.location.href` and not the shared collaborative text. No specific sanitization of the `url` input is strictly necessary *within the component* beyond what the `qrcode` library itself might do, as the source is considered to be the browser's current, valid URL. Standard browser security mechanisms for URLs apply.

## 4. General Recommendations

1.  **Continue Relying on Angular's Security Features:** Angular's built-in XSS protection (contextual sanitization) is effective. Avoid manual DOM manipulation (e.g., using `ElementRef.nativeElement.innerHTML = ...`) or explicitly bypassing Angular's sanitization (e.g., `DomSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml`) unless absolutely necessary and the implications are fully understood and mitigated.
2.  **Output Encoding for Non-Angular Contexts:** If data from TinyBase were ever to be used outside of Angular templates (e.g., generating reports, sending emails), ensure proper output encoding/sanitization is applied relevant to that context.
3.  **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Angular, TinyBase, `qrcode`, and other frontend dependencies to benefit from the latest security patches.
4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While the backend (`src/index.ts`) now adds a CSP header, ensure this policy is reviewed and refined as the frontend application evolves, especially if new third-party scripts or resources are added. The current backend CSP is a good baseline (`default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; ...`).
5.  **Educate on QR Code Risks (General):** While not a flaw in this app's code, users should generally be cautious about scanning QR codes from untrusted sources. This is general user education rather than an application vulnerability.

Overall, the scanned portions of the Angular frontend demonstrate good adherence to standard security practices, primarily by leveraging Angular's built-in protections. The areas of highest potential risk (rendering user-supplied collaborative data) appear to be handled safely.The `frontend_vulnerability_scan.md` report has been created.

It covers:
1.  **XSS**: No direct vulnerabilities found. Angular's default sanitization seems to be correctly utilized for data from TinyBase. `grep` for unsafe patterns was negative.
2.  **CSRF**: Low risk. Primary communication is via WebSockets. No traditional state-changing HTTP requests found. Auth cookie has `SameSite=Strict`.
3.  **QR Code Input Sanitization**: The QR code uses `window.location.href`, not user-shared data from TinyBase, as its input. This is considered safe in the context of the application's data flow.
4.  **General Recommendations**: Advised to continue using Angular's security features, keep dependencies updated, manage CSP, and general user education on QR code safety.

The analysis indicates a generally good security posture for the reviewed aspects of the frontend.
